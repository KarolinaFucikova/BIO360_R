# BIO360_R
Introduction to R for general ecology class

This project can be downloaded and unpacked as a folder. It serves as a starting point for further work. Consistent organization of projects ensures easy transfer of code from one project to another - we always have data in csv format in the subfolder 'data', R code in the 'src' folder, and in the end we will put output graphs into the folder 'plots'. The Rproj file will be outside those folders but within our project folder.

The 'data' folder contains example files that can be explored and graphed using basic R functions. More advanced ecological analyses will be conducted using the package 'vegan'.

The R script will not run as written - some parts are for students to modify and fill in blanks, according to instructions in the comments.
